## 🔐 Room Joining with Hash

- Public room ID is hashed using AES encryption.
- Hash is verified on join for secure invitation.
- No two hashes are the same due to unique IV usage.

---

## 🧠 Reconnection Logic

- If player refreshes page or loses connection:
  - Checks if room is ongoing or not.
  - Rejoins and syncs draw state and tickets.
  - Host and players are automatically restored.

## 📱 Invite Players via WhatsApp
